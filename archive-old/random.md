Market Understanding and Size


Clinical Trial Management is a billion-dollar business with an international market. Some of the biggest challenges of clinical trials are: subject data privacy, drug supply-chain management, and regulatory document tracking (just to name a few). Clinical trials often use a clinical trial management system (CTMS) to consolidate the management of all aspect of the trial into one place. Unfortunately, this is not always the case and many trials are managed using various systems for different purposes (i.e. one system for drug supply management, another for data management, IRB submissions, radiology, central labs, etc.). This means that a site with 5 ongoing trials could potentially have 30 different systems they must use

Ascelpius* is a Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) designed as a modular and fully-featured suite of tools for managing clinical trials built using Ethereum Smart-Contracts and IPFS. The platform is aimed at helping to expedite the research process, improve patient safety, reduce the regulatory burden of drug development, and maintain the highest levels of data integrity. Lastly, Asclepius will be the backbone of a global database of de-identified data from clinical trials. Ascelpius* is not just going to revolutionize clinical research management, it is going to contribute to the advancement of modern medicine to help make the world a better place for everyone.

On average, it takes about 10 years for a drug go from the lab to being available as a treatment on the market and only 1 in 10 of these treatments will make it to the market. Recruitment is one of the biggest challenges to clinical trials and the primary reason that clinical trials are terminated prior to completion is lack of participants. A clinical trial that is ended early will still have the data collected during time it was active but rarely is this data ever made available to the research community. 


Channels 3 and 1 will be additional modules available for subscribing via the DCSMS suite. Channels 4 and 2 will be free to any verified researcher regardless of their subscription status.

Clinical trials conducted across the globe are the driving force behind advances in medicine, breakthroughs in treatment, and the discovery of novel therapies. The design and management of clinical trials is a billion-dollar business with stakeholder groups such as pharmaceutical companies, contract research organizations, academic institutions, medical practices, and clinical laboratories. 

None of it would be possible if not for the sacrifices made by the individuals that take part in these trials. Often, patients can receive treatment that is sometimes more effective than those currently available on the market and at little to no cost. They can also receive an experimental treatment that is ultimately shown to not be effective or that has numerous side effects. The most common reason patients take part in clinical trials other than receiving access to promising treatment options is the altruistic desire to help advance medical knowledge. Clinical research would not be possible without these sacrifices and the willingness of patients.

On average, it takes about 10 years for a drug go from the lab to being available as a treatment on the market and only 1 in 10 of these treatments will make it to the market. Recruitment is one of the biggest challenges to clinical trials and the primary reason that clinical trials are terminated prior to completion. A clinical trial that is ended early will still have the data collected during time it was active but rarely is this data ever made available to the research community. Even datasets a percentage of trials that do reach completion is never made available for further research to build upon. Certainly, this does not help to convince patients to participate in research when they think that their sacrifice will not end up helping anyone.

Some of the biggest challenges of clinical trials are: subject data privacy, drug supply-chain management, and regulatory document tracking (just to name a few). Clinical trials often use a clinical trial management system (CTMS) to consolidate the management of all aspect of the trial into one place. Unfortunately, this is not always the case and many trials are managed using various systems for different purposes (i.e. one system for drug supply management, another for data management, IRB submissions, radiology, central labs, etc.). This means that a site with 5 ongoing trials could potentially have 30 different systems they must use. With a Blockchain based system, not only could made less complex, but it would offer several other valuable abilities.

Market Strategy
The go to market strategy will be executed in phases.
Phase 1 – A steering committee of Investigators from major institutions across the globe will be established to assist with this phase. A 1 month multi-site ‘test’ trial will be conducted at the steering committee sites. This trial will simply piggy-back an already existing trial, using the data collected for that protocol as ‘dummy’ data for DCSMS. The original trial will not be modified in any way nor will the patients be required to commit to any additional procedures but only need sign an additional informed consent for the use of the de-identified data. The results of Phase 1 will be used to fine tune DCSMS while having built some public awareness of the platform in the process.
Phase 2 – DCSMS availability;/l.k,j	 b1 will be expanded to any interested research site across the globe using Asclepius to draw interest of investigators. From a marketing standpoint, Asclepius will offer clinical researchers the opportunity to pioneer the genesis of the most comprehensive clinical database ever formulated. From a financial standpoint, retrospective data entered into Asclepius will give researchers early access to DCSMS modules as they are rolled out from beta to live. 
Phase 3 – DCSMS will be marketed to pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations with the value prospect already having gained hype through word of mouth and by key members of the clinical research network (many investigators, especially those on the steering committee, have relationships with big pharma companies). Some sites will already have the software installed and staff will already have at least a basic understanding of the system from Phase 2. 
Phase 4 – DCSMS is fully unchained. All core modules are live. Training materials and customer support are proactively assisting with the implementation for clients. 







Monetization Plan
The base DCSMS platform with Asclepius and the safety module will be free for any clinical site that requests access.
The Dockerized modules for the features of DCSMS will be subscription based with pricing based on the size of the trial and number of sites/patients involved. However, these modules will be offered as betas during Phase 2 at which time they will be no-cost. This is to establish a viable market while fine tuning the modules.

The bottom line.
Phases 1 and 2 will be cash burning periods but not without yielding an interested industry of established and connected researchers, institutions, and companies.
Phase 3 will see a shift into profitability aided by having the base system already in use by sites for Asclepius access.
Phase 4 will mark DCSMS fully clearing the runway with subscription revenue growing and technical support demand slowly lessening.


DESIGN/USABILITY
DCSMS will be a web-based portal application with a minimalistic but modern interface designed to facilitate a user-friendly experience while still making navigation between various modules as easy as selecting the module from a menu. The site mentioned earlier that had 30 different systems for 5 ongoing trials actually did exist and I was the research coordinator. I have used many of the systems that exist with some being well designed easy to use and others so terribly outdated they required browser versions that have not been supported for more than a few years. Site staff have a lot of responsibilities on their plate and DCSMS will be designed to make their jobs easier by saving them time and allowing them to work more efficiently. Site investigators are usually very busy individuals with very little time that is not already allocated to one obligation or another. These professionals, some very proficient with technology and some not so much, like to have a high-level view of the open trials at their site and therefore DCSMS will offer the minimalistic modern interface. Those leaning towards the techie side will be able to check the status on the fly while those with an apprehensiveness to technology becoming such a major part of medicine (they exist, trust me) will be relieved to see a platform that does not cause a sensory paralysis when logging in nor needing a textbook of training materials to get up and running.

A user who is completely unaware that DCSMS runs on Blockchain technology would not be made aware by using the platform itself. Blockchain technology is an incredible advancement in technology that will realize its fullest potential through implementations that increase efficiency but DO NOT increase complexity
