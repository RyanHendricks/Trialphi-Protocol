The TrialPhi Protocol is not designed to be the one protocol to cure them all (but if you look closer at the pharmaceutical industry you will find they aren't in the business of _cures_ since _treatments_ are much more profitable in the long run). But let's not single out any of future collaborators but rather instead look at the trend:

The TrialPhi is designed 

Phi, the 21st letter of the greek alphabet, has various meanings depending on the context or school of thoughy. As an acronym, PHI, protected health information, or, the basis of HIPAA which one could argue that although paramountly important has been a barrier to innovation in some respect. 

Phi also represents the golden ratio. This ratio is defined by taking dividing a number from  the fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, n, n+n<sub>-1</sub>, ...) by the preceding number in the sequence. The result, when rounded, gets ever closer to 1.618\. Who cares? Its an irrational number big deal, so is pi.. Yes, but it is _the most_ irrational number and unfortunately we have come to associate _irrational_ as non-desireable feature when in reality it is only due to our inability to define that causes this designation. The golden ratio, unlike pi, is everywhere around us. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px; text-indent: 2rem;">Phyllotaxis5, in botany, is the arrangement of leaves on the stem of a plant that often form a spiral around the stem at angles equal to different ratios of subsequent Fibonacci numbers. This phenomenon is further observed in the number of petals on numerous flowers6 and even in the arrangement of seeds on a sunflower7.</span>

The ratio of any two consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence has roughly the same value and as the sequence approaches infinity, this value approaches 1.618, known as the Golden Ratio (also known as divine proportion, golden mean, golden section, etc.) and is represented by the greek letter Phi.

Pine cones, shells, and DNA to hurricanes, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and even the spiral shape of our own Milky Way all follow this ratio. The idea that this ratio 1.618 or its inverse 0.618 (= 1/1.618) are so prominent in the world may not seem rational but ironically that is the crux of this entire premise. The Golden Ratio is the most mathematically irrational number that exists9 and allows for optimal organization requiring the least amount of energy.

<u>_TK TK 3 preceding paragraphs to be trimmed heavily._</u>

If you remember anything about Phi and the golden ratio remember this: it is the natural order of producing the most optimal organizational strategy requiring the least amount of energy.

TrialPhi. Get it? Got it? Good, cause now shits about to get heavy. 

Complex systems at the edge of chaos... bear with me... have the ability to undergo drastic reorganizations whereas systems that have above a minimum threshold of "order" rarely undergo any large scale changes. The Clinical Trials industry is on the edge of chaos but very few are able to see the forest for the trees and those that do will tell you without hesitation that:

**<u>Clinical Trials are Broken</u>**

Blockchains (distributed ledgers or whatever you prefer to call them) will be a disruptive force across many industries. TrialPhi, however, will not be a 'disruptor' to clinical research but rather the catalyst of a paradigm shift. The creators of the TrialPhi protocol, with our collective experience and wisdom, have discovered this golden opportunity to make a immeasurable positive impact in the lives of our fellow earthdwelllersTK. So although clinical trials may be broken, the TrialPhi story does not end with us selling you a token. (har har har). In fact, the ERC-20 standard namespace "PHI" is ownable, shareable, mintable, and transferrable, (this is solidity speak), by anyone just has knowledge and wisdom should be. As surprised as we were to find that no one had chosed the three letter combination that to us has such great meaning we were even more surprised to find that the concept of TrialPhi had not already been conceived and molded into a profit churning factory of medical mumbo jumbo jargon bottom line boosting profit. TK probably should eliminate everything back to the corny rhyme.

## 2017 - July

FDA Guidance "<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px; text-indent: 2rem;"></span>[<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px; text-indent: 2rem;">IRB Waiver or Alteration of Informed Consent </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px; text-indent: 2rem;">for Clinical Investigations Involving No More </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px; text-indent: 2rem;">Than Minimal Risk to Human Subject</span>](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM566948.pdf)<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px; text-indent: 2rem;">". TLDR = Studies that meet the following criteria can be waived from requiring consent of human participants (guidance released without public comment period): </span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px; text-indent: 2rem;">1\. The clinical investigation involves no more than minimal risk **<u>(as defined in 21 CFR 50.3(k) </u>**</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px; text-indent: 2rem;">**<u>or 56.102(i)) to the subjects</u>**;***</span>

2\. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects;

3\. The clinical investigation _**could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or**_<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px; text-indent: 2rem;">_**alteration**_; and</span>

There are patients on both sides of the spectrum. Most with the more terminal conditions tend to not <strike>give a shit</strike> be as concerned about risk. This guidance in the hands of those who aren't putting patients first can be dangerous. <sarcasm> Fortunately, there are very few stakeholders involved that might think along those lines. </sarcasm></span>

## 2017 - August (draft released July 27)

The Meat & Potatoes. 

FDA Guidance - "[Use of Real-World Evidence to <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px; text-indent: 2rem;">Support Regulatory Decision-Making </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px; text-indent: 2rem;">for Medical Devices</span>](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm513027.pdf)"<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px; text-indent: 2rem;"></span>  

TLDR = read the last 2 paragraphs on page 12 and then read them again. RWE and RWD must be understood. The following couple of pages can be skimmed as it is merely the FDA laying out bulletpoint by bulletpoint the ways in which the Quality and Reliability will be measured. (makes that deliverable easier to some extent). Pages 17 up through the glossary define remarkably clear use-cases/pathways to testing a protocol like TrialPhi rather than beat ourselves to death trying to come up with one now we have to struggle with limiting ourselves to only one. (or not). 

TK it might not hurt to glance over the glossary in all honestly. its short but very relevant should we continue down this path not traveled.

**<u>Marketing</u>**

TrialPhi Protocol. A name not chosen simply for the cheesiness of golden ratios and irrational numbers. TrialPhi top google results are directly relevant to clinical trials due to PHI being hipaa related.  Proper SEO implementation and campaign can trialphi.com & trialphi.network at spots 1 and 2 without much effort.
