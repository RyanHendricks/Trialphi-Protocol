# BSIC Hackathon Weekly Checkpoints


## Pragmatic Clinical Trials
### Decentralized Governance & Protocol Framework

> Understanding challenges from various stakeholder viewpoints with different and often conflicting interests isn't easy. Striking a balance where all parties feel they've gained is a cornerstone of success. This is the point of confluence programs of change should target.  <h6>

## Week 1 September 7 - September 14: Defining assumptions**


Advances in medical therapies are largely informed by evidence generated in clinical trials which research a medical strategy, treatment, or devices for its safety and efficacy against human disease. However, with so many pieces of information required for participation, the patient’s medical data is insecure and could risk being manipulated. Based on Oncology studies, mismanagements in clinical trials include:

### Data Mismanagement:
Patient data is often spread across many different systems and risks being manipulated such as
• Drug supply-chain management
• Regulatory document tracking
• IRB submissions
• Radiology results
• Central labs  
 
### Patient Rights/privacy section:
Patient privacy acts are compromised. The patient is not in control of who sees their medical history.

### Incomplete or terminated trials:
Poor accrual was the most common reason for premature termination. These trials not only contribute little to the clinical science knowledge base but also divert volunteers and financial resources from progress. 
 
### Blockchain Solution
Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger and increase trust by making data manipulation near impossible. This in turn has the potential to reduce patient risk, allow researchers to make more informed decisions, and puts some of the power back in the hands of the very human beings that make research possible by making the use of their data more transparent. The patient-centered solution resulting in increased participation due to patients being more empowered will be a game-changer since patient recruitment is one of biggest challenges of clinical research. 


### Market size
Market size is international. Estimates roughly 40 billion at the end of 2016 and expected to grow to roughly 65 Billion by 2020 to 2022.


### Competitors
There are no other blockchain solutions being used in the Clinical Trial industry as of this writing. Currently, clinical trial management systems (CTMS) maintains, manages, and collects, participant contact information, tracking deadlines and milestones. However, these systems are geared toward the clinical trial management and may not contain all the information needed aspects of needed information for a clinical trial This means that a site with multiple ongoing trials could potentially have 30 different systems they must use. 

### Competitors include: IBM Clinical Development - CMS platform. Helps organize but patient still isn’t in control simple trials: project management tool. non applicable






**Week 2 September 14 - September 21: Pain points and user story**

## Who are your clients/users? (persona of your user)
Clinical Trial Stakeholders:
* Patients and Patient Groups
* Investigators, Academic Institutions, and Research Sites
* Contract Research Organizations & Sponsors
* Regulators (FDA, IRBs, NIH, HHS)


## What are their pain points?
The common thread that hinders clinical trial completion is recruitment. Whether it s patients unaware of the availability of trials, sites and researchers too busy to recruit effectively, or CROs and sponsors that don’t take into account patient feedback in trial design.



##  What is your product's value proposition?



##  What is your distribution and go-to-market strategy? Who can you partner with?


#### Potential Partners
* The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI)—a public-private partnership whose members include representa- tives from the FDA, National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and academic, industry, and patient advocacy groups.


##  What are the risks associated with your solution?
Interview respondents acknowledged that not all patient groups are created equal in terms of what they can contribute to a clinical trial. The most important elements for effective patient group engagement include establishing meaningful partnerships, demonstrating mutual benefits, and collaborating as partners from the planning stage forward. Although there is a growing appreciation by sponsors about the benefits of patient group engagement, there remains some resistance and some uncertainty about how best to engage. Barriers include mis- matched expectations and a perception that patient groups lack scientific sophistication and that “wishful thinking” may cloud their recommendations. Conclusions: Patient groups are developing diverse skillsets and acquiring assets to leverage in order to become collaborators with industry and academia on clinical trials. Growing numbers of research sponsors across the clinical trials enterprise are recognizing the benefits of continuous and meaningful patient group engagement, but there are still mindsets to change, and stakeholders need further guidance on operationalizing a new model of clinical trial conduct.


##  What is the impact of your solution? How will it be measured?



##  Define the technical specifications and development roadmap



##  Define your impact criteria and how you measure it
(1) establishing mean- ingful partnerships, (2) demonstrating mutual benefits, and (3) collaborating early and often.

**Week 3 September 21 - September 28: Develop your product**
