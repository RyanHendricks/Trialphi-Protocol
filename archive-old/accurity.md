### Market size
Market size is international. Estimates roughly 40 billion at the end of 2016 and expected to grow to roughly 65 Billion by 2020 to 2022.


### Competitors
There are no other blockchain solutions being used in the Clinical Trial industry as of this writing. Currently, clinical trial management systems (CTMS) maintains, manages, and collects, participant contact information, tracking deadlines and milestones. However, these systems are geared toward the clinical trial management and may not contain all the information needed aspects of needed information for a clinical trial This means that a site with multiple ongoing trials could potentially have 30 different systems they must use.

### Competitors include:
IBM Clinical Development CMS platform. Helps organize but patient still isn’t in control simple trials: project management tool. non applicable

#### Potential Partners
The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) — a public-private partnership whose members include represenτatives from the FDA, National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and academic, industry, and patient advocacy groups.

###  What are the risks associated with your solution?

Interview respondents acknowledged that not all patient groups are created equal in terms of what they can contribute to a clinical trial. The most important elements for effective patient group engagement include establishing meaningful partnerships, demonstrating mutual benefits, and collaborating as partners from the planning stage forward. Although there is a growing appreciation by sponsors about the benefits of patient group engagement, there remains some resistance and some uncertainty about how best to engage. Barriers include mis- matched expectations and a perception that patient groups lack scientific sophistication and that “wishful thinking” may cloud their recommendations. Conclusions: Patient groups are developing diverse skillsets and acquiring assets to leverage in order to become collaborators with industry and academia on clinical trials. Growing numbers of research sponsors across the clinical trials enterprise are recognizing the benefits of continuous and meaningful patient group engagement, but there are still mindsets to change, and stakeholders need further guidance on operationalizing a new model of clinical trial conduct.


###  What is the impact of your solution? How will it be measured?
Accurity will be assessed using endpoints.

###  Define the technical specifications and development roadmap



###  Define your impact criteria and how you measure it
1. Reduced regulatory burden on investigators and research site staff. As measured by regulatory infractions and user experience surveys with comparisons.
2. Increased patient engagement and satisfaction. As measured by a survey and compliance
3. Implementation working group discussions with stakeholder steering committees reprenting CROs, Patient Groups, PIs, and Pharma/Biotech companies.

### Our Mission
Implement a program of change that
(1) establishing meaningful partnerships, (2) demonstrating mutual benefits, and (3) collaborating early and often.
