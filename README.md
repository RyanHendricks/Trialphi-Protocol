# TrialÎ¦Protocol :sunflower: :shell:

The Clinical Trials industry is responsible the creation of therapeutic interventions and advancement of medical science.
Despite the massive value generation and cashflows this multi-billion dollar industry is crumbling. Even the FDA agrees.

The TrialPhi Protocol is a tactically-timed, minimum implementation, clinical protocol template designed to ease the current strain on all stakeholder groups as the reorganization of the industry accelerates.

Key Features:
*Blockchain-Agnostic* - complete abstraction of individual blockchains into a behind the scenes framework is not that far away and TrialPhi will ready when it happens.
*Patient-Centered* - via outcomes reporting, engagement initiatives, and feedback loops as a governance mechanism
*Dynamic Endpoints* - facilitating the change that is already happening and providing a common foundation to ensure everyone still keeps the same basic goals in mind.

Key Outcomes
*Improved Participation* - from patients **and** researchers which is an outcome the industry will support and an everybody-wins scenario
*Reduced Regulatory Burden* - 10 years is the average for a drug hit the market for drug approval TK
*


from the laboratory white board to the  one of the most complex mechanisms machines humanity has ever
 has such an opportunity existed where
The TrialPhi Protocol is not designed to be the one protocol to cure them all
