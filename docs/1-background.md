# Background

Advances in medical therapies are largely informed by evidence generated in clinical trials which research a medical strategy, treatment, or devices for its safety and efficacy against human disease. The number one reason that Clinical Trials fail and are terminated early is lack of recruitment. These trials not only contribute little to the clinical science knowledge base but also divert volunteers and financial resources from progress.

## The Problem

**Clinical Trials** are **Broken**.

>"I personally believe, like many other people, that the clinical trial system we have right now is broken. It isn’t working to meet the objectives that we need it for. Our inability to generate the needed evidence efficiently and in a cost-effective manner will continue to be a barrier to innovation and to the quality of care around the world.”  
[**Janet Woodcock**, Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research **(CDER)** at the Food and Drug Administration **(FDA)**, Sept 2017.](https://www.bna.com/clinical-trials-system-n73014464323/)

## Data Transparency

Patient data is often spread across many different systems and risks being recorded incorrectly somewhere along the paper trail. Examples of these systems are:

* Drug supply-chain management (IP Accountability)
* Regulatory document tracking (TMF, Site Regulatory & Patient Binders)
* IRB submissions
* Radiology results
* Central labs

## Stakeholders

* Patients and Patient Groups
* Investigators, Academic Institutions, and Research Sites
* Contract Research Organizations & Sponsors (Pharma, Manufacturers, etc.)
* Regulators (FDA, IRBs, NIH, HHS)

## Blockchain Solution

Why a blockchain?

### Immutability & Data Integrity

Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger and increase trust by making data manipulation near impossible. This in turn has the potential to reduce patient risk, allow researchers to make more informed decisions, and puts some of the power back in the hands of the very human beings that make research possible by making the use of their data more transparent. The patient-centered solution resulting in increased participation due to patients being more empowered will be a game-changer since patient recruitment is one of biggest challenges of clinical research.

### Governance & Voting Mechanisms

Smart contracts running on the blockchain enable members of the ecosystem to vote on various issues presented and their say has an impact, programmatically, as to whether certain proposals are adopted or rejected.
