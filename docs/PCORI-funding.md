**PCORI National Priorities are:**

Assessment of Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options: Comparing the effectiveness and safety of alternative prevention, diagnosis, and treatment options to see which ones work best for different people with a particular health problem.
Improving Healthcare Systems: Comparing health system–level approaches to improving access, supporting patient self-care, innovative use of health information technology, coordinating care for complex conditions, and deploying workforce effectively.
Communication and Dissemination Research: Comparing approaches to providing comparative effectiveness research information, empowering people to ask for and use the information, and supporting shared decision making between patients and their providers.
Addressing Disparities: Identifying potential differences in prevention, diagnosis, or treatment effectiveness, or preferred clinical outcomes across patient populations and the healthcare required to achieve best outcomes in each population.
Accelerating Patient-Centered Outcomes Research and Methodological Research: Improving the nation’s capacity to conduct patient-centered outcomes research, by building data infrastructure, improving analytic methods, and training researchers, patients, and other stakeholders to participate in this research.

**Improving Methods for Conducting PCOR - Cycle 1 2018**

Notice of Upcoming PCORI Funding Announcement 
This notice provides information about an upcoming Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) funding announcement (PFA), which will be released by PCORI on January 16, 2018. PCORI seeks to fund projects that address important methodological gaps and lead to improvements in the strength and quality of evidence generated by PCOR/CER studies. For the Cycle 1 2018 Methods PFA, PCORI has identified the following Research Areas of Interest (RAIs) as programmatic priorities:  

Methods Related to Ethical and Human Subjects Protections (HSP) Issues in PCOR/CER
Methods to Improve Study Design
Methods to Support Data Research Networks
Methods to Improve the Use of Natural Language Processing
Proposed research should be justified with respect to published scientific literature and designed to advance methods for PCOR/CER. Projects that simply apply methods or approaches to a particular domain, seek to disseminate an approach, or focus on infrastructure development will not align with program priorities. 

Methods Related to Ethical and Human Subjects Protections (HSP) Issues in PCOR/CER
PCORI is interested in funding projects that address important ethical and HSP issues related to the conduct of PCOR/CER. Applications responding to this RAI must include an empirical component; purely conceptual and theoretical work will be considered nonresponsive. Preference will be given to proposals that seek to develop or test new approaches rather than those that conduct primarily descriptive work.

The following topics are considered priorities for this RAI:

Methods to improve consent processes for participation in clinical research in the context of conventional randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies conducted in learning healthcare system settings, cluster randomized trials, pragmatic trials, or adaptive trials. Note: Projects focusing on informed decision making and consent in the context of clinical care will be considered nonresponsive
Methods to assess the concept of minimal risk in clinical research (including clinical trials)
Methods to improve review and monitoring of PCOR/CER, including protocol adherence and adjudication of study outcomes
Methods to Improve Study Design
PCORI is interested in funding projects that foster improvements in the use of specific study designs to address PCOR/CER questions. Preference will be given to proposals that seek to evaluate the proposed methods using both simulations and data from real-world studies.

The following topics are considered priorities for this RAI:

Methods to improve the design and conduct of cluster randomized trials, including methods to account for the dependence of observations within clusters
Methods to support the inclusion of patient preferences for allocation of interventions in randomized designs while minimizing threats to internal validity
Methods to manage adaptation of treatment strategies while minimizing threats to internal validity in studies of complex interventions
Methods to improve the design and conduct of PCOR/CER studies in circumstances limiting the use of RCTs
Methods to Support Data Research Networks
PCORI is interested in funding projects that improve the quality of data and analyses for multi-site PCOR/CER using data research networks. Projects that focus on infrastructure development and/or capacity-building for specific platforms will be considered nonresponsive.

The following topics are considered priorities for this RAI:

Methods to improve distributed analyses in data research networks       

Methods to evaluate optimal network designs and analytical approaches (e.g., distributed regression, meta-analysis)
Methods to improve data quality in data research networks        

Methods to assess dimensions of data quality (e.g., completeness, accuracy, consistency)
Methods to prevent, mitigate, or impute missing or inaccurate data and improve understanding of mechanisms of missingness and implausibilities in electronic health records (EHRs) and distributed data settings
Methods to determine optimal linkage of multiple data sources, such as EHRs, claims, and national registry data
Methods to conduct patient-level disambiguation for de-identified linkage of data across networks
Methods to Improve the Use of Natural Language Processing
PCORI is interested in funding projects that develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) and other related methods for leveraging free-text clinical information contained in electronic health records (EHRs) for PCOR/CER. Proposals that simply seek to apply NLP to a particular clinical context will be considered nonresponsive.

The following topics are considered priorities for this RAI:

Methods to improve concept parsing in the extraction of valid medical information from EHRs
Methods to develop more effective and efficient approaches to the use of annotation when extracting data from unstructured text in EHRs
Methods to address issues associated with negation in the extraction of data from EHRs
