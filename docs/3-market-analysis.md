# Market Analysis

## Potential Partners

* The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) — a public-private partnership whose members include representatives from the FDA, National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and academic, industry, and patient advocacy groups.

### Potential Risks

Growing numbers of research sponsors across the clinical trials enterprise are recognizing the benefits of continuous and meaningful patient group engagement, but there are still mindsets to change, and stakeholders need further guidance on operationalizing a new model of clinical trial conduct.

## Value Proposition(s)

1. Potential to obtain a CPIM with the FDA
2. Alternative or combination option of COA tool pathway.[COA info](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DrugDevelopmentToolsQualificationProgram/ucm284077.htm)
3. Position Blockchain-based Technology in a position to make a substantial positive impact at the December 18, 2017, meeting "Patient focused drug development"  [Meeting Information](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/patient-focused-drug-development-collecting-comprehensive-representative-input-tickets-8952600469)
4. Success of one or more of the 3 above items is a major step towards opening the funding flood gates for project above and beyond the scope of TrialPhi.

And a few more channels  
* Small Innovation Research Program
* Small Business Technology Program
* Grants & Funding Opportunities at NIH

Potential outcomes of CPIMs include efforts leading to:

* Regulatory submissions of clinical trials with new designs and methods
* Proposals for the use of emerging technologies
* Proposals for biomarker qualification or the use of biomarkers in regulatory submissions
* Natural history studies
* Public workshops and future collaboration of FDA with external parties
* Development of new guidance
* Formation of new consortia and public-private partnerships to advance regulatory science efforts

## Market Timing

The following 3 guidance documents were released by the FDA in the past 2 months. Market timing for the TrialPhi Protocol could not be better.

### FDA Guidance September 2017

[FDA Guidance for the Advancement of Emerging Technology Applications for Pharmaceutical Innovation and Modernization - Guidance for Industry](https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-drugs-gen/documents/document/ucm478821.pdf)  
A plea to drug makers to innovate and a truly unusual level of support for novel ideas to be put into practice. Page 1 footnote excerpt: For the purpose of this document, emerging technology should be novel in the context of the pharmaceutical and related industries and it should have the potential to modernize the pharmaceutical manufacturing body of knowledge related to product quality. Emerging technology will be new to FDA in the context of pharmaceutical quality, with limited prior experience and knowledge. 3 This program is also open to companies or manufacturers that intend to include emerging technology in a drug master file (DMF) that will be referenced by the planned application(s). The steps to request participation in the program are described in section III.B Process.

### FDA Guidance July 2017
[FDA Guidance "IRB Waiver or Alteration of Informed Consent For Clinical Investigations Involving No More Than Minimal Risk to Human Subjects](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM566948.pdf)  
Studies that meet the following criteria can be waived from requiring consent of human participants (guidance released without public comment period):

1. The clinical investigation involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects
1. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects;
1. The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration
1. Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information following participation.

The **<u>bottom line</u>** is that minimal risk is no longer what you or I define as minimal risk but rather what some **governing body** (think DAO ~ solution ~ patient-defined) says is the "minimal risk". There are patients on both sides of the spectrum. Most with the more terminal conditions tend to not be as concerned about risk. This guidance in the hands of those who aren't putting patients first can be dangerous. Fortunately, there are very few stakeholders involved that might think along those lines.

### FDA Guidance August 2017

FDA Guidance - "[Use of Real-World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Medical Devices</span>](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm513027.pdf)"

The FDA laying out bulletpoint by bulletpoint the ways in which the Quality and Reliability will be measured. Pages 17 up through the glossary define remarkably clear use-cases/pathways to testing a protocol like TrialPhi.
