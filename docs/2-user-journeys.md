# Pain Points & Personas

## User Journey 1

Tina (auditor) arrives at a site 6 months after they started recruiting patients for a study. Upon review of the consent forms she finds that 0 (NONE, zilch, nana) out of 15 were done correctly. Meaning that although the subject may have signed the signature page they had not initialed the other pages as per GCP [(good clinical practice](https://www.google.com/search?q=ich+gcp&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS764US764&oq=ich+gcp&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1218j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)). She reports this information back to the CRO who then reports to the sponsor but her note that if the issue had been corrected from the onset at the first signed consent it may have prevented the 14 additional that were also incorrect. Not only does the role of the auditor become more difficult but the job of being a human being becomes even harder for someone with passion for what they do and has empathy for the patients who make the sacrifices to advance medicine as she does.

*In all fairness to the FDA, this guidance was issued with the potential to do far greater good than it might do bad but we believe it may be a step in the wrong direction.*

## User Journey 2

Dr. Asclepius is well regarded practicing physician and has just taken on the role of PI (principal investigator) because not only does he have a passion for treating his patients but he has the desire to advance medical science. He doesn't need to the additional revenue or responsibilities as he is over the hill of his career but he TK. 8-months after the start of the trial a monitor arrives to audit the trial documents. Dr. A is excited to receive feedback on his progress and recruitment efforts although one patient did have an allergic reaction and another a hospitalization (both are adverse events ["AE"s]; chemotherapy drugs very often have even worse side effects). Can you imagine the disappointment he must feel when the auditor (who feels just as bad to be the bearer of bad news) tells him that he did not properly document both of the above instances and subsequently they are now protocol violations.

Dr. A is heartbroken. He had recorded the events just as he would have in his regular practice, which although succinct, and did not realize it needed to be done differently in the clinical trial context. Dr. A takes special care to not let the issue happen again during the trial. After the trial completes, he decides to not take on any further research trials out of the worry of an simple oversight causing lasting damage to his reputation. And as he sadly becomes another "one and done" investigator** he sadly asks the question "why is so hard to make a positive impact in the word?" and "if only I had known this from the start it would have never caused me such distress." "I wish there was a standard (super simple one page almost) framework or protocol for this process..." "sigh".

This is a documented trend: [One and done: Reasons principal investigators conduct only one FDA-regulated drug trial](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S245186541630093X)

**<u>Clinical Trials are BROKEN.</u>**

*Clinical Research audit-raised issues*
* **Action item** = issue outstanding, not tracked once address
* **Minor Protocol Deviation** = deviated from the protocol = documented and tracked even after addressed.
* **Major Protocol Deviation** = documented + reported to IRB + reviewable by regulators. Relating to the integrity of the research and safety of the participants.

> For this project I had to come up with "personas" and "user journeys". I really struggled with it. So instead I decided to just use real experiences instead of fictional ones and these stories are the result of that decision. Only slightly exaggerated and both within the last 6 months.
