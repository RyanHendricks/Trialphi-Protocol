## Our Mission

Phi, the 21st letter of the greek alphabet, has various meanings depending on the context or school of thoughy. As an acronym, PHI, protected health information, or, the basis of HIPAA which one could argue that although paramountly important has been a barrier to innovation in some respect. 

Phi also represents the golden ratio. This ratio is defined by taking dividing a number from  the fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, n, n+n-1, ...) by the preceding number in the sequence. The result, when rounded, gets ever closer to 1.618. Who cares? Its an irrational number big deal, so is pi.. Yes, but it is the most irrational number and unfortunately we have come to associate irrational as non-desireable feature when in reality it is only due to our inability to define that causes this designation. The golden ratio, unlike pi, is everywhere around us. Phyllotaxis, in botany, is the arrangement of leaves on the stem of a plant that often form a spiral around the stem at angles equal to different ratios of subsequent Fibonacci numbers. This phenomenon is further observed in the number of petals on numerous flowers and even in the arrangement of seeds on a sunflower.

The ratio of any two consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence has roughly the same value and as the sequence approaches infinity, this value approaches 1.618, known as the Golden Ratio (also known as divine proportion, golden mean, golden section, etc.) and is represented by the greek letter Phi.

Pine cones, shells, and DNA to hurricanes, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and even the spiral shape of our own Milky Way all follow this ratio. The idea that this ratio 1.618 or its inverse 0.618 (= 1/1.618) are so prominent in the world may not seem rational but ironically that is the crux of this entire premise. The Golden Ratio is the most mathematically irrational number that exists9 and allows for optimal organization requiring the least amount of energy.

If you remember anything about Phi and the golden ratio remember this: it is the natural order of producing the most optimal organizational strategy requiring the least amount of energy.

Complex systems at the edge of chaos... bear with me... have the ability to undergo drastic reorganizations whereas systems that have above a minimum threshold of "order" rarely undergo any large scale changes. The Clinical Trials industry is on the edge of chaos but very few are able to see the forest for the trees and those that do will tell you without hesitation that:

**<u>Clinical Trials are Broken</u>**

Blockchains (distributed ledgers or whatever you prefer to call them) will be a disruptive force across many industries. TrialPhi, however, will not be a 'disruptor' to clinical research but rather the catalyst of a paradigm shift. The creators of the TrialPhi protocol, with our collective experience and wisdom, have discovered this golden opportunity to make a immeasurable positive impact in the lives of our fellow earthdwelllersTK. So although clinical trials may be broken, the TrialPhi story does not end with us selling you a token. (har har har). In fact, the ERC-20 standard namespace "PHI" is ownable, shareable, mintable, and transferrable, (this is solidity speak), by anyone just has knowledge and wisdom should be. As surprised as we were to find that no one had chosed the three letter combination that to us has such great meaning we were even more surprised to find that the concept of TrialPhi had not already been conceived and molded into a profit churning factory of medical mumbo jumbo jargon bottom line boosting profit. TK probably should eliminate everything back to the corny rhyme.

## Development Roadmap

The development timeline of accurity will be very familiar to the Clinical Trials industry and is as follows

* *Phase I* -
* *Phase II* -
* *Phase III* -
* *Phase IV* -
* *Approval* -
* *Post Approval* -

## Marketing

TrialPhi Protocol. A name not chosen simply for the cheesiness of golden ratios and irrational numbers. TrialPhi top google results are directly relevant to clinical trials due to PHI being hipaa related.  Proper SEO implementation and campaign can trialphi.com & trialphi.network at spots 1 and 2 without much effort.
